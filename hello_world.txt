Writing a good commit is important.
The perfect commit message is made out of
    1. subject= concise summary of what happened.
    2. Body= more detailed explanation.
        - what is now different than before?
        - what's the reason for the change?
        - Is there anything to watch out for / anything particularly remarkable?
